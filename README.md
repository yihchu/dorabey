# Dorabey

Why call it 'dorabey'? It is made of 'dora' and 'bey'. 'Dora' means 'pandora' and 'doraemon'. 'Pandora' has endless possibilities, and 'doraemon' has the power to do what Da Xiong() wants. 'Bey' has the similiar pronunciation with 'beibei', who is my first dog. So the name is in memory of my dog, and I expect it can be with me like 'beibei' and bring me relaxed, beautiful, hopeful life.
